# FlaskApp
A simple contact database app with a RESTful API. Built with Flask and SQLite for simplicity. 
## How to run
Create a virtual environment of your choice and install the requirements with pip. 
You can run the app by navigating to the main folder and running:
```bash
flask run
```

It should start running by default on http://127.0.0.1:5000. The swagger API documentation is available at the root domain and should show up if you run it in a browser.

Tested with Python 3.12
